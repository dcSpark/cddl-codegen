# Testing roadmap — what to do next

A curated, opinionated plan for the *next* testing push, so a future effort has a solid starting
point. This is the short list (what we'd actually do, in order), distilled from an independent
multi-agent review (`draft/testing-recommendations/RECOMMENDATIONS.md` — the exhaustive menu) plus
findings from building the current suite. See `tests/README.md` for how the current setup works and
what's already covered.

## Recommended next steps, in priority order

### Tier 1 — the strategic investment (a focused multi-day effort)

1. **Emit a property round-trip harness into the generated crate.** *(~2–4 days; then free per
   type)* `proptest` + `arbitrary`, behind a flag (e.g. `--emit-tests`). The generator is the only
   thing that knows each type's exact fields/bounds/optionality, so it can emit a better
   `Arbitrary` + round-trip test than any hand-written one, for **every** type automatically. This
   is the single highest-leverage missing oracle — it turns "output didn't change" into "output is
   correct." Do this when you want to go deep on correctness.
   - Follow-on once this exists: **encode-fidelity properties** for `preserve`/`canonical`
     (`bytes → T → bytes` byte-identical over arbitrary valid encodings) — the only at-scale test
     of those high-stakes flags.

### Tier 2 — project-specific, highest signal (when data sourcing is feasible)

2. **Real on-chain CBOR corpus + differential vs the sibling libraries.** *(medium)* This is the
   Cardano `cddl-codegen`; real blocks/txs are the richest fuzz seeds and the existing hand-written
   sibling libs make cross-implementation differential testing nearly free. Higher signal than any
   synthetic data.

3. **Wire-format back-compat + generated-API semver.** *(medium each)* For a serialization tool
   these are correctness contracts the snapshot suite doesn't cover: (a) bytes written by an older
   generator still deserialize under newer generated code (pin a few `(spec, bytes)` vectors);
   (b) `cargo-semver-checks` against a golden generated crate so a renamed field / changed
   signature surfaces as a reviewed API break.

### Tier 3 — validation & process (opportunistic)

4. **`cargo-mutants`** scoped to the emit core (`--file 'src/generation*'`), nightly + `--in-diff`
   on PRs. The defining technique for a codegen tool — proves the suite *catches* wrong-codegen
   bugs, not just covers lines. Only bites once #1 gives assertions with teeth; needs
   `cargo-nextest` as the runner.

5. **`prettyplease` instead of shelling to `rustfmt`.** Removes toolchain-dependent formatting
   churn and the `which` dependency, compiles fast, never bails (`syn` is already a dep). Lower
   urgency only because the pinned toolchain already mitigates churn.

## Explicitly not worth it (decided, not overlooked)

- Full `2^N` flag powerset / PICT pairwise — curated named profiles already cover this; revisit
  only if a flag-interaction bug actually slips through.
- `quickcheck` alongside `proptest`; `goldenfile`/`expect-test` as a second corpus engine;
  `no-panic` lints; coverage instrumentation of *generated* code; `trybuild` for whole-crate
  compile-pass (the corpus `cargo check` is simpler and broader).
