# cddl-codegen

Experimental library for generating rust code for CBOR (de) serialization from CDDL specs.

### Purpose ###

Instead of hand-writing code for CBOR parsing and writing tests to make sure it matches your CDDL spec, it's much faster to just generate the code from the spec! It will save time and make it easier to keep all your code in sync with any changes to your specification.
